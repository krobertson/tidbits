This is a collection of various little bits and useless
things I've written over time.

== autossh

This is a quick little script to add your machine's SSH key to a remote server's
authorized_keys file.  This saves you from having to copy/paste it to the server.
Saves only a little bit of time, but useful as I regularly work with a number of
virtual machines, many of them temporary, and got tired of manually doing it.

== mod_authn_dbd_vhost

This is a module for Apache, based off of mod_authn_dbd, which supports
querying based on the site's current host header.  For one project,
I had a dynamic vhost that had separate users for each possible host header.
This allowed me to do it without a separate vhost entry for each one in order to
specify different realms.

== mod_dav_svn_vhost

This module is a diff for Subversion 1.4.6 to patch mod_dav_svn so that it
appends the current host header to the SVNParentPath directive.  With this,
I can have one vhost entry and have it used for multiple hosts each with separate
set of repositories.
